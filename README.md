Slightly upgraded version of York's GPA Calculator, which can be found at:

https://laps.yorku.ca/student-resources/gpa-calculator/.

Main upgrades over the current one found on the York site:

1. Save/load courses and grades feature using localstorage. This saves tons of time not having to input each course manually. Especially useful in upper years.

2. Calculate 3 GPAs at once: overall cumulative GPA, major specific GPA, and a custom GPA using a subset of all your courses. Especially useful when eligibility for certain programs, awards, etc. depends on different GPAs. User can also repurpose "major" GPA into a second custom GPA if desired.

3. Increased course input slots. Specifically useful for engineers who take 150 credits (at an average of 3 credits per course, the current calculator accommodates only 40x3=120 credits).
